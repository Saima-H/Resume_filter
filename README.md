# Resume_filter
A workflow proposed to filter resumes , in order to select the best candidates to be interviewed.
Proposed workflow:

This project automates the transition from unstructured resume text to a definitive hiring verdict. It uses a three-phase pipeline to quantify candidate potential through Geometric Mean Scoring and Rule-Based Arbitration.The Three-Phase ArchitecturePhase 1: Intelligent Data Ingestion (The Extraction)Process: Converts raw PDF text into a structured JSON dataset.Normalization: The AI extracts and scores four core metrics on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:S (Skills): Technical proficiency.T (Trajectory): Career growth and velocity.I (Impact): Measurable achievements and leadership.R (Relevance): Alignment with the specific industry or role.Persistence: Parsed data is stored in a SQLite database to eliminate redundant API costs and enable high-speed lookups.Phase 2: Weighted Mathematical Scoring (The Filter)Geometric Mean Formula: Applies role-specific exponents ($a, b, c, d$) based on the persona (Junior, Executive, or Specialist):$$Score = S^a \times T^b \times I^c \times R^d$$Direct Shortlisting: Scores $>75\%$ are automatically flagged for Direct Shortlist.Direct Rejection: Scores $<50\%$ are automatically flagged for Direct Reject.The "Yellow Zone": Candidates scoring between $50\%–75\%$ are passed to Phase 3 for deeper analysis.Phase 3: Compensatory Brain (The Logic)Logic: A rule-based engine resolves ambiguity by identifying specific candidate strengths that math might miss:Rule A (Transferable Expert): High Skills ($S$) compensate for low Relevance ($R$).Rule B (High Potential): Top-tier Trajectory ($T$) compensates for low total Experience ($exp\_years$).Rule C (Stagnant Specialist): Low Trajectory/Impact ($T$ or $I$) negates high Skills/Tenure.Key Technical FeaturesMulti-Persona Support: Dynamic weighting shifts (e.g., Executive roles prioritize Impact, while Junior roles prioritize Skills).Database-Driven Workflow: Uses SQLite for data persistence, allowing for instant re-evaluations for different roles without re-parsing PDFs.Resilient Design: Built-in error handling with exponential backoff to manage LLM API rate limits.Anti-Cheating Logic: Because it uses a Geometric Mean, a "zero" in any core category (like a total lack of skills) cannot be hidden by a high score in another—the whole score collapses to zero.
